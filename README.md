My map page can be accessed [here](https://z1675605.github.io/my_tiles/).

I focued my map onto seattle as a way to be familiar with how my map would affect surounding areas. I am most fmiliar with the area so I won't have to guess how landmarks were affected.

My first tileset is a basic basemap from Mapbox with little changes to the base settings,

My second tileset is an outdoor based map that focuses on the terrain of the land than actual streets. I focused on an area with a rangind landscape such as Alaska which shows mountain ranges and height of the land.

My third tileset is a custom map theme that focuses on administrative and government buildings that could provide as resources to those in need, it is based on my project about lack of food access in geography. The normal land is a shade a blue and important landmarks are red.
